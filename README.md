## Project #1
## Food and Drink Menu

Members are Edna Omadjambe, Katherine Shuhua Fang, Roman Sokol, Dak Pruett and Chris Holtz

We created the Food and Drink Menu so the user can select a food type or a drink type and our menu will display recipes.  We used forward and back buttons to scroll through the records in the Array.  Animation was integrated into the HTML and JavaScript to add interest and make it a little more fun for the user.

We selected the (themealdb API) and (thecocktaildb API) because of the variety of choices and the way the data was organized.
We all like to eat and drink and we hope this project will give the user fun choices.

The animation focused around advanced CSS.
We used a simple Fetch call to access the API data.

We had several challenges;  Deciding what we were going to do was our first hurdle.  
Ultimately, we kept it simple and decided on the food and beverage app.
Getting the data to display on a single page and scroll to the next page was difficult and we still would like to refine the way got it done.
GitHub challenged us every step of the way, starting with an unclear understanding of the use and best practices.
We pulled it all together in the end to have a working app that accomplished most of what we set out to do.

Future development would include a built in history feature.
Interactive paring of food and drinks.
The ability to search by individual ingreadients.
Improving the animation of the menu page and adding more pages to give it a book feel.
